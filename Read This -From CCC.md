Hello! 

Thank you for downloading this. 

We are still a starting game dev studio. With "we", I mean "I". As of this update, I am the sole developer of this studio.

Note: Please remember that I am nowhere near professional and have only done indie game development.

Note in using this:
 • Download the Solar2D software from https://solar2d.com/ 
 • Start the program.
 • Open project
 • Open the folder
 • Click the "main" file.
 • That's it! 

   -Yours truly, Creative Cat's Club
